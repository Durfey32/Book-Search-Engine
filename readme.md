# Book Search Engine

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
The **Book Search Engine** is a fully functional web application that allows users to search for books and manage a personal reading list. This project refactors the original RESTful API code to use GraphQL, which streamlines data handling and improves the efficiency of user interactions. Users can search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorites for easy access later. Authentication is implemented with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), enabling users to sign in or sign up securely and access the site without repeated logins within a session period.
